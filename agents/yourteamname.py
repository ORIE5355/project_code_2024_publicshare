        ### note that you will need to change the name of the path and this agent file when submitting
        ### complications: pickle works with any machine learning models defined in sklearn, xgboost, etc.
        ### however, this does not work with custom defined classes, due to the way pickle serializes objects

        This function is called every time the agent needs to choose an action by the environment.

        The input 'obs' is a 5 tuple, containing the following information:
        -- new_buyer_covariates: a vector of length 3, containing the covariates of the new buyer.
        -- last_sale: a tuple of length 2. The first element is the index of the agent that made the last sale, if it is NaN, then the customer did not make a purchase. The second element is a numpy array of length n_agents, containing the prices that were offered by each agent in the last sale.
        -- state: a vector of length n_agents, containing the current profit of each agent.
        -- inventories: a vector of length n_agents, containing the current inventory level of each agent.
        -- time_until_replenish: an integer indicating the time until the next replenishment, by which time your (and your opponent's, in part 2) remaining inventory will be reset to the inventory limit.

        The expected output is a single number, indicating the price that you would post for the new buyer.
